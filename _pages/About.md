Mu Zhu acquired a dual Bachelor's Degree in Electronic Engineering and Finance from Zhengzhou University before relocating to the United States to pursue a Master's Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Delaware. His interest in cybersecurity and encryption led him to dedicate a significant portion of his Master's studies to these areas.

Under the guidance of Dr. Munindar P. Singh during his doctoral studies at NCSU, Mu delved deeper into the field of cybersecurity, completing his Ph.D. in 2024. Influenced by Sun Tzu's renowned book, The Art of War, which posits that all warfare is rooted in deception, Mu's primary research focus became defensive deception, a strategy used to confuse, lure, and mislead digital attackers.

After earning his Ph.D., Mu returned to China to further his research on attack behavior analysis and the enhancement of defense technologies and strategies.
